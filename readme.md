## MyMovieDB

MyMovieDB is a personal movie collection management system written in Node.js and React. The user can search for films based on title, year, genre, actors, or rating. The user can also add new films, edit existing films, and delete films.

### To install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### To run the app:

```
gulp
```

Gulp should open a new browser window for you, but if it doesn't, just point your browser to:

```
localhost:3000
```
